    "I've enjoyed chess for a long time and have wanted to dive into machine learning in the deep end right away.  For this project, I would like to analyze the position of the pieces for the most likely outcome given equal skilled players.  In order to gather the data for this project, I will initially load PGN(portable game notation for games) data gathered from https://www.ficsgames.org/download.html for games above 2000 rating.  From this data, I created a a data loader to interpret each move and create a snapshot of the game after each move, and hopefully from this project I can create a model that will predict who will likely win from the given state of the game."

    "All the data I have gathered is from https://www.ficsgames.org/download.html, which provides data for a lot of games, over 7000 in January 2018 alone, which is the file I am currently using.  The data provided however is not a csv, but PGN, so I wrote an interpreter to translate the moves in the file to actual board states after every move, and from these game states, I wrote the result for testing the data, the number of each piece for each player and their total number of pieces, along with the piece and the its color for each square on the board, flattening the board object.  I did not even load the entire file and there is still over 50,000 rows."
